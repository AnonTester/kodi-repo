		<summary>Move or delete after watching</summary>
		<description>After watching a movie or episode:
- Move or delete
- Rate on library
- Show quit menu/Log off/Turn off display

The alternate file management method is used to be compatible with SMB and NFS shares. When using only local (mounted) paths, it's recommended not to activate this method (moving files will be much faster).

NOTE: "Allow file renaming and deletion" under Settings -> Appearance -> File Lists needs to be enabled in order for this plugin to work.
